## JavaScript Libraries for PDF Generation:

### jsPDF
- **Ease of Integration:** Easy to integrate but limited for complex layouts, more suited for simple tasks.
- **Features:** Limited in comparison to pdfKit, suitable for small to medium applications.
- **Memory Usage:** Not ideal for large documents due to memory constraints.
- **Documentation:** [jsPDF Documentation](https://artskydj.github.io/jsPDF/docs/jsPDF.html).
- **Evidence:** [Memory Management for Large PDF Documents in jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF/issues/3756).
- **Functionality:** Enables developers to create PDF documents directly in the browser without server-side processing.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for small to medium applications, limited scalability.
- **Hyperlinks:** Not clickable.

### pdfKit
- **Capabilities:** Offers good capabilities, especially for server-side use with integration with other languages like Python.
- **Features:** Allows more control over the PDF creation process, including text, images, and vector graphics.
- **Suitability:** Ideal for high-load environments on the server side.
- **Scalability:** Good for client-side use in small to medium applications.

### Html2pdf.js
- **Functionality:** Creates PDFs from HTML content, may struggle with complex HTML/CSS.
- **Usability:** Designed for simplicity, specifically for HTML.
- **Dependency:** Relies on other libraries like jsPDF for performance.
- **Hyperlinks:** Clickable.
- **Output:** Generates PDFs where text is not selectable (reference).

## Python Libraries for PDF Generation:

### WeasyPrint
- **Functionality:** Converts HTML to PDF.
- **Usability:** Simple to use, supports CSS.
